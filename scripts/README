### Script Usage

1. In the `pbi_cfg.json` file, modify the following parameters:

    `"source_workspace"` - workspace where the base dataset is

    `"target_workspace"` - workspace where you want to deploy to per client

    `"use_subset"` - deploy a subset of coids or all of the `coids`

    `"db_name"` - name of the database

    `"db_type"` - type of the database server. The value is either 

    `SQL Server` or `Postgres`

    `"db_server"` - url of the database server

    `"report_name_prefix"` - Prefix for the report names. All reports will be prefixed with this name

    `"coid"` - Coid of the client

2. For the selected db, the script expects two environment variables present on the machine before running the script:

    `DBUSER` - username of the database
    
    `DBPASSWORD` - password for the user


3. On windows machines, Run the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` to make sure the script can be executed without certificate

4. Run the command `./pbi_deploy.ps1`

5. The script will prompt for the powerbi login. Login and the script will continue automatically
